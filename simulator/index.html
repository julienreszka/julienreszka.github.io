      <h1>Optimal Public Spending Simulator</h1>
      <p>
        This web app simulates the Armey curve, showing the relationship between
        public spending (% of GDP) and economic growth rate using a quadratic
        model: Growth = β₀ + β₁*(G/Y) + β₂*(G/Y)². Adjust parameters to see the
        curve and optimal spending level.
      </p>

      <details>
        <summary>About the Armey Curve</summary>
        <div style="margin-top: 15px; line-height: 1.6">
          <p>
            The Armey curve is an economic model that describes the relationship
            between the size of government spending and economic growth. It
            posits that as government spending increases from zero, economic
            growth initially rises because essential public goods—like
            infrastructure, the legal system, and education—boost prosperity and
            stability. However, after reaching an optimal point, further
            increases in government size lead to diminishing returns,
            inefficiency, and crowding out of private investment, so economic
            growth then declines.
          </p>

          <h3>Curve Structure</h3>
          <p>
            The Armey curve is typically illustrated as an inverted U-shaped
            (parabolic) graph. On the horizontal axis is government spending
            (often as a percentage of GDP), and on the vertical axis is economic
            growth or societal welfare. The "peak" of the curve represents the
            optimal government size for maximum growth. Empirical research
            commonly situates this optimum between 20% and 30% of GDP, though
            the exact figure varies by country and time period.
          </p>

          <h3>Mathematical Formulation</h3>
          <p>The curve is often expressed with a quadratic equation:</p>
          <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">
            Y = α + β₁ · G + β₂ · G²
          </p>
          <p>
            where Y is economic growth, G is government spending, and
            coefficients β₁ > 0, β₂ < 0 capture the concave shape—positive
            effects at first, negative effects after the turning point.
          </p>

          <h3>Policy Implications</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              An undersized government fails to provide basic public goods,
              resulting in low growth due to lack of order, security, and
              infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>
              An oversized government leads to inefficiencies, less incentive
              for private enterprise, and lower economic growth due to excessive
              regulation, high taxation, and crowding out.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Historical Context</h3>
          <p>
            The Armey curve is named after U.S. Representative Dick Armey, who
            popularized it in the 1990s. Its logic parallels the Laffer curve,
            but focuses on the broader scope of government spending rather than
            just tax rates.
          </p>

          <h3>Comparative Findings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Optimal government size can vary with factors like openness of the
              economy, population size, and national context.
            </li>
            <li>
              Empirical studies find different threshold values for optimal
              government size in countries such as the U.S., France, Kenya,
              Turkey, and Georgia—ranging from less than 20% up to 30% of GDP.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In summary, the Armey curve highlights that both too little and too
            much government spending can harm economic growth, and seeks to
            identify the optimal share that maximizes prosperity.
