      <h1>Economic Curves Simulator: Armey, Laffer, and J-Curve</h1>
      <p>
        This web app simulates three key economic curves: the Armey curve
        (public spending vs. economic growth), the Laffer curve (tax rates vs.
        consent to taxation), and the J-Curve (policy shocks vs. economic
        recovery). All use parametric models to illustrate dynamic
        relationships. Adjust parameters to explore different scenarios.
      </p>

      <div id="curves-grid">
        <section id="armey-section" aria-labelledby="armey-heading">
          <details open>
            <summary>About the Armey Curve</summary>
            <div style="margin-top: 15px; line-height: 1.6">
              <p>
                The Armey curve is an economic model that describes the
                relationship between the size of government spending and
                economic growth. It posits that as government spending increases
                from zero, economic growth initially rises because essential
                public goods—like infrastructure, the legal system, and
                education—boost prosperity and stability. However, after
                reaching an optimal point, further increases in government size
                lead to diminishing returns, inefficiency, and crowding out of
                private investment, so economic growth then declines.
              </p>

              <h3>Curve Structure</h3>
              <p>
                The Armey curve is typically illustrated as an inverted U-shaped
                (parabolic) graph. On the horizontal axis is government spending
                (often as a percentage of GDP), and on the vertical axis is
                economic growth or societal welfare. The "peak" of the curve
                represents the optimal government size for maximum growth.
                Empirical research commonly situates this optimum between 20%
                and 30% of GDP, though the exact figure varies by country and
                time period.
              </p>

              <h3>Mathematical Formulation</h3>
              <p>The curve is often expressed with a quadratic equation:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">
                Y = β₀ + β₁ · G + β₂ · G²
              </p>
              <p>
                where Y is economic growth, G is government spending, and
                coefficients β₁ > 0, β₂ < 0 capture the concave shape—positive
                effects at first, negative effects after the turning point.
              </p>

              <h4>Understanding the Intercept (β₀)</h4>
              <p>
                The positive intercept value β₀ represents the
                <strong
                  >natural growth rate without government intervention</strong
                >. This is the baseline economic growth rate that would occur
                when G = 0 (zero government spending), driven purely by private
                sector activity including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Private sector dynamics:</strong> Businesses,
                  entrepreneurs, and markets operating without government
                  involvement
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Natural productivity gains:</strong> Technological
                  innovation, efficiency improvements, and capital accumulation
                  driven by private actors
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Spontaneous market coordination:</strong> Voluntary
                  exchanges and market mechanisms that create value
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Population growth effects:</strong> Demographic
                  changes that contribute to economic expansion
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In essence, β₀ represents the growth rate of a purely
                laissez-faire economy where all economic activity comes from
                private initiative, without any government provision of public
                goods, infrastructure, regulation, or spending. The rest of the
                curve then shows how government spending can initially enhance
                this natural growth (through beneficial public goods) before
                eventually hindering it (through inefficiencies and crowding
                out).
              </p>

              <h3>Policy Implications</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An undersized government fails to provide basic public goods,
                  resulting in low growth due to lack of order, security, and
                  infrastructure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An oversized government leads to inefficiencies, less
                  incentive for private enterprise, and lower economic growth
                  due to excessive regulation, high taxation, and crowding out.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Historical Context</h3>
              <p>
                The Armey curve is named after U.S. Representative Dick Armey,
                who popularized it in the 1990s. Its logic parallels the Laffer
                curve, but focuses on the broader scope of government spending
                rather than just tax rates.
              </p>

              <h3>Understanding Negative Growth Rate Values</h3>
              <p>
                In the mathematical model, government spending levels beyond the
                optimal point can produce negative growth rate values. While
                sustained negative growth (economic contraction) is possible in
                reality, these extreme negative values represent theoretical
                scenarios of economic dysfunction:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Economic stagnation:</strong> Excessive government
                  spending (beyond the optimal point) creates such massive
                  inefficiencies and crowding out of private investment that the
                  economy contracts rather than grows.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Regulatory capture:</strong> Oversized government
                  becomes dominated by special interests and rent-seeking
                  behavior, leading to resource misallocation and economic
                  decline.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Investment flight:</strong> Private businesses and
                  entrepreneurs abandon the economy due to excessive
                  bureaucracy, high taxes needed to fund large government, and
                  lack of economic freedom.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Productivity collapse:</strong> Innovation,
                  entrepreneurship, and productive economic activity become so
                  constrained by government interference that overall economic
                  output shrinks.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In practice, extremely negative growth rates would signal
                economic crisis and would likely trigger policy corrections
                before reaching the theoretical extremes suggested by the
                mathematical model.
              </p>

                  Optimal government size can vary with factors like openness of
                  the economy, population size, and national context.

                <li>
                  Empirical studies find different threshold values for optimal
                  government size in countries such as the U.S., France, Kenya,
                  Turkey, and Georgia—ranging from less than 20% up to 30% of
                  GDP.

              </ul>

              <p>
                In summary, the Armey curve highlights that both too little and
                too much government spending can harm economic growth, and seeks
                to identify the optimal share that maximizes prosperity.

            <summary>About the Laffer Curve</summary>
            <div style="margin-top: 15px; line-height: 1.6">
              <p>
                The Laffer curve illustrates the theoretical relationship
                between rates of taxation and the resulting levels of consent to
                taxation. It suggests that at a tax rate of 0%, consent is zero
                (no taxes means no need for consent), and at 100%, consent
                becomes -100% because there is no incentive to work or produce
                under complete confiscation. Between these extremes, consent
                rises to a maximum and then falls.
              </p>

              <h3>Curve Structure</h3>
              <p>
                The Laffer curve is depicted as an inverted U-shaped graph. The
                horizontal axis represents the tax rate (from 0% to 100%), and
                the vertical axis shows consent to taxation. The peak indicates
                the optimal tax rate that maximizes societal acceptance, beyond
                which higher rates reduce consent due to disincentives and
                resistance.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Important note on the y-axis:</strong> The y-axis
                doesn't measure literal revenue but rather the theoretical
                economic health and viability of the tax system. Thus, negative
                values serve as a warning of extreme disincentives and economic
                dysfunction rather than actual negative tax revenue.
              </p>

              <h3>Why Consent to Taxation Increases Initially</h3>
              <p>
                Consent to taxation rises from 0% to the optimal point for
                several interconnected reasons:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Social contract fulfillment:</strong> As tax rates
                  increase from zero, governments can provide essential public
                  goods (defense, law enforcement, infrastructure) that citizens
                  value, creating legitimate reasons for taxation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Economic productivity gains:</strong> Moderate
                  taxation enables public investments that boost overall
                  economic productivity, making the tax burden worthwhile as
                  citizens see their living standards improve.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Perceived fairness:</strong> When tax rates are
                  reasonable and well-spent, citizens view taxation as a fair
                  contribution to collective welfare rather than confiscation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Institutional trust:</strong> Effective government
                  services funded by moderate taxes build public trust in
                  institutions, increasing voluntary compliance and acceptance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Collective benefit recognition:</strong> Citizens
                  understand that moderate taxation enables shared benefits
                  (education, healthcare, infrastructure) that would be
                  impossible to achieve individually.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Beyond the optimal point, consent declines as the marginal costs
                of higher taxes (reduced incentives, economic inefficiency)
                outweigh the marginal benefits of additional government
                services.
              </p>

              <h3>Mathematical Formulation</h3>
              <p>The curve can be modeled with a quadratic equation:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">
                R = β₀ + β₁ · t + β₂ · t²
              </p>
              <p>
                where R is tax revenue, t is the tax rate, β₀ is often 0, β₁ >
                0, and β₂ < 0 to create the parabolic shape. More advanced
                models may use different functional forms.
              </p>

              <h3>Policy Implications</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If tax rates are below the peak, increasing them can boost
                  revenue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If rates are above the peak, cutting taxes can stimulate
                  economic activity, leading to higher revenue over time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It highlights the trade-off between tax rates and economic
                  incentives, influencing debates on supply-side economics.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Historical Context</h3>
              <p>
                Popularized by economist Arthur Laffer in 1974 during a meeting
                with U.S. policymakers, the concept has roots in earlier
                thinkers like Ibn Khaldun (14th century) and John Maynard
                Keynes. It gained prominence in the 1980s under Reagan's tax
                cuts.
              </p>

              <h3>Understanding Negative Revenue Values</h3>
              <p>
                In the mathematical model, tax rates above 50% produce negative
                revenue values. While negative tax revenue is impossible in
                reality, these values represent theoretical economic collapse
                scenarios:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Economic collapse:</strong> Extremely high tax rates
                  (above 50% in this model) create such massive disincentives
                  that economic activity collapses to the point where the
                  government would theoretically need to pay people to engage in
                  economic activity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Underground economy:</strong> People completely exit
                  the formal, taxable economy and move to barter, black markets,
                  or simply stop productive activity altogether.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Capital flight:</strong> Businesses and wealthy
                  individuals leave the country entirely, taking their economic
                  activity with them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Disincentive effects:</strong> Work, investment, and
                  entrepreneurship become so unprofitable that they essentially
                  cease, creating a death spiral where the tax base evaporates.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In practice, governments would see revenue approach zero rather
                than go negative, as the economy would collapse or transform
                into an untaxable shadow economy.
              </p>

              <h3>Comparative Findings</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The consent-maximizing rate is often estimated around 25% for
                  a balanced budget maximizing long term growth.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                In summary, the Laffer curve demonstrates that tax rates and
                revenue are not linearly related, emphasizing the need to find
                the optimal rate that maximizes government income without
                stifling economic growth.

            <div style="margin-top: 15px; line-height: 1.6">
              <p>
                The J-Curve shows what happens to an economy after a major
                policy change, like when a country suddenly devalues its
                currency or implements drastic budget cuts. The name comes from
                the "J" shape of the curve: things get worse before they get
                better. First, the economy dips down (the bottom of the J), then
                gradually recovers and eventually improves beyond where it
                started (the upward hook of the J).
              </p>

              <h3>How It Works</h3>
              <p>
                Imagine the graph: time moves along the bottom (months or
                years), and economic health goes up and down on the side. When a
                big policy change happens, the economy starts at a normal level,
                immediately drops to a low point, then slowly climbs back up and
                eventually rises higher than before. This creates a shape that
                looks like the letter "J".
              </p>

              <h3>The Math Behind It</h3>
              <p>The curve follows this pattern:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">
                Y(t) = Base + Slope · t - Depth · (1 - e^{-t / τ})
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What this means in plain English:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Base:</strong> Where the economy started before the
                  shock
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Depth:</strong> How bad things get initially (the
                  deeper the dip, the harder it hits)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>τ (tau):</strong> How long the pain lasts (higher
                  number = longer recovery time)
                </li>

                  <strong>Slope:</strong> How fast the economy improves in the
                  long run
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Why Does It Get Worse First?</h3>
              <p>
                When a government makes a big change, the negative effects hit
                immediately while the positive effects take time to materialize:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Immediate price shocks:</strong> If a currency loses
                  value, imports become more expensive right away, but it takes
                  time for exports to increase (people still buy the same things
                  out of habit).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Loss of confidence:</strong> People and businesses
                  panic and cut back spending, making things worse temporarily.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Budget cuts hurt first:</strong> When government
                  spending gets slashed, jobs are lost and services disappear
                  before new private sector growth can replace them.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>What This Means for Policy</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Patience required:</strong> Governments must endure
                  the difficult period to reach the recovery phase.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Support helps:</strong> Providing temporary assistance
                  (like unemployment benefits or food aid) can make the dip less
                  severe.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Warning sign:</strong> If the economy doesn't start
                  recovering after the expected time, the policy might not be
                  working (the J turns into an L - permanent decline).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Real-World Examples</h3>

              <h4>Poland's "Shock Therapy" (1990-1992) - A Success Story</h4>
              <p>
                After communism fell in 1989, Poland implemented one of the
                first and most successful shock therapy programs under economist
                Leszek Balcerowicz. The country faced hyperinflation (600%),
                food shortages, and obsolete state-owned industries.
              </p>

              <h5>The Reforms (What They Did)</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Price liberalization:</strong> Removed government
                  price controls on nearly all goods
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Currency reform:</strong> Made the zloty internally
                  convertible and allowed market exchange rates
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Budget discipline:</strong> Ended deficit financing by
                  the central bank and controlled wage growth
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Trade opening:</strong> Eliminated import restrictions
                  and created uniform tariffs
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h5>The Dip (Things Got Worse)</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>GDP fell 9.78% in 1990 and 7.02% in 1991</li>
                <li>Unemployment jumped from 0.3% to 6.5% in one year</li>
                <li>Many inefficient state companies closed immediately</li>
                <li>Widespread anxiety about economic future</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>The Recovery (Things Got Better)</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sustained growth:</strong> GDP grew steadily at 6-7%
                  annually through the late 1990s and 2000s
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Best in Europe:</strong> Poland's GDP increased
                  826.96% from 1989-2018, the highest growth in Europe
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Only EU economy to avoid 2008 recession:</strong>
                  Continued growing during the global financial crisis
                </li>
                <li>
                  Consumption of goods (cars, appliances, food) boomed as living
                  standards rose
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upgraded to "developed market" status by FTSE Russell in 2018
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Why Poland Succeeded</h5>
              <p>
                Unlike Russia's chaotic transition, Poland had several
                advantages: private agriculture still existed, democratic
                institutions were stable, privatization was more gradual and
                equitable, and the country maintained some social safety nets.
                This shows that shock therapy can work—but the details of
                implementation matter enormously.
              </p>

              <h4>Argentina's Economic Shock (2023-2025) - Ongoing</h4>
              <p>
                President Javier Milei took office in Argentina in late 2023 and
                immediately implemented radical economic changes, creating a
                textbook J-Curve scenario:
              </p>

              <h5>The Reforms (What He Did)</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Currency devaluation:</strong> Let the peso drop in
                  value from 400 to 800 per US dollar
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Budget cuts:</strong> Slashed government spending from
                  over 5% deficit to achieve a surplus
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Deregulation:</strong> Removed many government
                  controls on business and markets
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h5>The Dip (Things Got Worse)</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Economy shrank: -1.6% in 2023, -3.5% in 2024</li>
                <li>Inflation soared to 237% per year</li>
                <li>Poverty jumped from 38% to 53% initially</li>
                <li>Many people lost jobs and businesses struggled</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>The Recovery (Things Got Better)</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Inflation dropped dramatically to under 3% per month</li>
                <li>Poverty fell back to 38% by end of 2024</li>
                <li>Economy projected to grow +5% in 2025</li>
                <li>
                  First budget surplus in 14 years (government income exceeds
                  spending)
                </li>
                <li>Argentina's credit rating improved</li>
                <li>Currency stabilized with only 1% monthly devaluation</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>The Ongoing Challenge</h5>
              <p>
                By mid-2025, the recovery showed some fragility. The economy
                contracted again in Q2 2025, showing that J-Curves aren't always
                smooth. Global economic conditions and other factors can slow
                the recovery, reminding us that these reforms are risky and
                don't always work as planned.
              </p>

              <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Timing matters:</strong> The worst part usually lasts
                  6-18 months, but recovery can take years
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Context matters:</strong> Countries that trade a lot
                  with other nations (like Argentina) tend to see sharper
                  J-Curves - deeper dips but faster recoveries
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Not guaranteed:</strong> Just because you make painful
                  reforms doesn't mean recovery is certain - the economy could
                  stay depressed (an L-shape instead of a J-shape)
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Understanding Negative Values on the Chart</h3>
              <p>
                When the curve dips below zero, it represents a genuine economic
                crisis: businesses closing, people losing jobs, money fleeing
                the country, and widespread hardship. These negative values show
                the real human cost of economic shocks before recovery begins.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Bottom line:</strong> The J-Curve teaches us that major
                economic reforms often cause significant pain before delivering
                benefits. It's like economic surgery - the recovery period is
                tough, but the goal is to emerge healthier than before.
