## 🎲 Game Rules

### The Goal

Reveal your friends and foes. Discover common allies and enemies within the crew.

### The Roll

Every turn, flip a coin and roll a dice:

- **Heads** = Friend, **Tails** = Enemy
- **Dice (1-6)** determines closeness:
  1. Closest (best friend, sibling, daily person)
  2. Tight circle (core friends/family weekly)
  3. Regular circle (good friends, work crew)
  4. Loose associates (gym, neighbours, old classmates)
  5. Distant network (online, mutuals)
  6. Public/Celebrity (influencers, famous people)

### The Reveal

Name a person who fits the description and explain why.

- Can't answer? **Drink** or **Share a Secret**!

### The Vote

The crew votes **AYE** (agree) or **NAY** (disagree).

- If **NAYs** win: You're rejected! Drink or recruit a random stranger who agrees with you.
